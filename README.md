# Simple DepthMap 3D Animation

This project demonstrates a basic depth map 3D animation, rendering videos using depth mapping techniques. Below are examples of the rendered animations.

## Videos

Here are some examples of the output videos:

1. [Video 1](result/1.mp4)
2. [Video 2](result/2.mp4)
3. [Video 3](result/3.mp4)
4. [Video 4](result/4.mp4)
5. [Video 5](result/5.mp4)
6. [Video 6](result/6.mp4)
7. [Video 7](result/7.mp4)
